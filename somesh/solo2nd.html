    <h1>SUNG JIN-WOO</h1>
    <p>Sung Jinwoo (성진우) is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. He is the strongest hunter in the world and the second Shadow Monarch, having inherited the position from his predecessor Ashborn.

        Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, Jinwoo got the chance of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System, giving him the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint. As a result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him by the System, Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's greatest hunter.
        Jinwoo is a humble and benevolent individual who cares deeply for his family and has an ardent desire to become stronger. As a result, he shares a close relationship with his sister and his mother, and rarely wastes an opportunity to refine his skills and gain more power. His deep bond with his family also makes him absolutely merciless towards anyone who dares to hurt them, as displayed when he massacred Groctar and his minions for attempting to kill Jinah, and murdered Hwang Dongsoo for torturing Jinho.</p>
