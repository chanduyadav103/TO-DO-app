            <h2>P.SOMESH</h2>
            <p>hello there i'm somesh, worked in various projects as a full stack developer.my technical skills lies in
                html,css,javascript for front-end.coming to the back-end i use node.js,react frameworks to build a
                website.for the database nosql and mangodb is primarily used.
                I'm always learning, whether it's a new framework, a better way to solve a problem, or just a random
                tech hack that
                makes coding more fun. I enjoy working with teams, brainstorming ideas, and turning them into real,
                working products.
                When I'm not coding, i travel to other places and learn new things about the culture and places.i'd like
                to learn new frameworks and new technologies to improve my knowledge and give better results to the
                clients. </p>
